#Spring Notes
###Source - O'Reily course - Spring Framework Essentials
+ Spring framework does not perform actual inversion of control. It is more of a historical thing. Actually it performs dependency injection.
+ `@Configuration` annotation on a class tells spring the class will provide the metadata required to provide the beans.
+ Spring also provides some built in library classes.
+ Spring helps in the decoupling of classes, by handling the dependencies.
+ Spring metadata can be configured using following three ways
    + Using a xml config file.
    + Using annotations as and when required.
    + Using a Java configuration file that uses `@Configuration` annotation. (Recommended).
